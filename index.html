			Hi, I'm Sam. I'm from Washingtion state, US and I've always enjoyed and been skilled at logical pursuits such as programming and math. That, compounded with the fact that my parents are nerds as well and my Dad does software for a living, means that I began learning programming quite young and at this point I've written projects in several different languages (including my own website and an app that was on the apple app store for a while). When I'm not doing programming, I enjoy solving interesting math, playing table-top rpgs with friends, playing a handful of games (Minecraft and World of Warcraft seem to be my "go to"s these days), reading novels, and watching some animes.

			This wasn't part of the format for the page so I'll include it here, here is <a href="https://adventure.amospia.com/">my website</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/SamAng219255?tab=repositories">GitHub Respositories</a> so you can take a look and see what I've been up to. There is a repository for the website so you can look at the source code as well. My website, at the moment, is cluttered with old projects (I need to clean that up), but the latest ones are the map under the "Minecraft" link and the "TTRPG Stat Blocks" link.

			<p>Washington state is the north-western most state of the continguous United States. The state is often known for its mountains, pine trees, rain, and the city of Seattle, which is the largest city in that part of the country. These features, however, are largely exclusive to the western side of the state. The eastern region is vastly different. Dominated by the Columbia River Basin, most of eastern washington could be considered a semi-destern or shrub-steppe. Its shape was carved from the rock by monumental floods during the ice ages leaving a rolling sandy landscape separated by steep cliffs carved from the native basalt.</p>
